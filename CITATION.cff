abstract: >-
  The Small Watershed Nutrient Forecasting Tool (SWIFT) is designed for rapid estimation
  of sediment and nutrient loads from small U.S. watersheds. Developed by the United States
  Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS), SWIFT utilizes readily
  available information such as watershed size, land use, and location to generate load
  estimates presented as distributions that capture the inherent uncertainties in the methods used.
  It is based on export coefficients for major U.S. land use categories derived from the Soil and
  Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and employs delivery ratios informed by data from the Conservation
  Effects and Assessment Project (CEAP).
