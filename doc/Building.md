## Building SWIFT

SWIFT will be built *out-of-source*, which means that all intermediate and final files are **not** entangled with the sources. This allows keeping the source tree clean, all generated resources by the build can be quickly removed. In addition, multiple SWIFT build flavors can be build using the single source tree.

```cmake
file(GLOB sources src/*.f90)
add_executable(${SWIFT_EXE} ${sources})
```

### Generate the Build files

Make the `swift` directory the current working directory. All command examples below assume this.

```bash
$ cd <dir>/swift
```

Now, create all build files. Issue one of the following commands to configure and generate the build files. This does not build SWIFT yet. CMake will process the content of the file `CMakeLists.txt` and will generate the build system.

The command below reads the `CMakeLists.txt` source file from the current directory `.`, creates a directory `build` and stores all resources for the build in it.

```bash
$ cmake -S . -B build
  <or short>
$ cmake -B build
```

You can force `cmake` to use the GCC `gfortran` compiler.

```bash
$ cmake -B build -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran
```

If you want to use Intel Fortran to build SWIFT, configure as below. It defaults to `gfortran` otherwise.

The Intel `ifort` Fortran compiler will be deprecated in 2024 and is being replaced with the LLVM-based version, `ifx`. Therefore, the use of `ifx` is preferred. To generate the build files on Linux:

```bash
$ cmake -B build -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort
  <or better>
$ cmake -B build -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifx
```

On Windows you can use VS Code to build SWIFT or you can issue the commands below to use the different compilers:

```bash
$ cmake -B build -D CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET=fortran=ifort
$ cmake -B build -D CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET=fortran=ifx
$ cmake -B build -G "Ninja" -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran
```

>  *__Note__: `ifort` and `ifx` use a different generator toolset than `gfortran``  on Windows, also use the windows default CLI, not Powershell to build on the command line.*  



If you want to create a `Debug` version of SWIFT that includes symbols for debugging, configure as below. Use the `Release` flag for building a release version instead.

```bash
$ cmake -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

If you want to delete all files created by `cmake`, simply remove the build folder and start over, e.g. on Linux

```bash
$ rm -rf build
```

or using the Windows terminal:

```powershell
> rd /s /q build
```

### Compiling/Linking the Executable

To build the SWIFT executable, use the `cmake --build` command in the `swift` directory. It will process the previously generated files in `build` and place all intermediate resources (`*.o`, `*.mod` files) into the build directory.

```bash
 $ cmake --build build
```

Use the `-j` option to compile the source files in parallel. The example below is using `8` CPU cores in parallel. This greatly speeds up the compile process.

```bash
 $ cmake --build build -j 8
```

You can find the SWIFT executable in the build folder as `swift-<version>-<arch>.exe` (for Windows). The Linux and Mac executable will not have an `.exe` extension.

Call the build target `clean` to remove all generated object files (`.o`) and modules files (`.mod`). Alternatively, you can do (`cd build; make clean`).

```bash
 $ cmake --build build --target clean
```

Building the SWIFT model is supported for various platforms and compilers as described in the `Readme.md` file. It contains the specific instructions for Windows and Mac builds.

### Installing

Finally, you can install the `swift` executable by using the `--install` CMake option. Specify the installation directory that will receive a copy of the SWIFT executable, generated in `build`. The `--prefix` option takes as an argument the base of the binary directory. Not using `--prefix` will copy `swift` into the system default binary directory. You don't have to use this step if you want to manage moving the swat executable yourself.

```bash
$ cmake --install build --prefix ~/bin
```
